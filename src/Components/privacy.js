        <h2>PART E – TRANSFERS AND DISCLOSURES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>Other than as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose Personal Information to any external organization without your consent unless we are required or permitted to do so by law, including in the event of a corporate amalgamation, reorganization, change of control or sale.</p>
        <p>Your Personal Information may be stored, processed or otherwise used by us, our affiliates or our service providers, both inside and outside of Canada. As a result, that country’s courts, governments or law enforcement agencies could obtain disclosure of your information in accordance with that country’s laws.

We conduct audits and monitor compliance with our privacy practices.</p>

When we no longer are required to retain the information, we will destroy, erase, or de-identify the information. Legal requirements, however, may require us to retain some or all of the Personal Information we hold for a period of time that is longer than that for which we might otherwise hold.</p>
